abstract = {{Wind work at the air-sea interface is the transfer of kinetic energy between the ocean and the atmosphere and, as such, is an important part of the ocean-atmosphere coupled system. Wind work is defined as the scalar product of ocean wind stress and surface current, with each of these two variables spanning, in this study, a broad range of spatial and temporal scales, from 10 km to more than 3000 km and hours to months. These characteristics emphasize wind work's multiscale nature. In the absence of appropriate global observations, our study makes use of a new global, coupled ocean-atmosphere simulation, with horizontal grid spacing of 2–5 km for the ocean and 7 km for the atmosphere, analyzed for 12 months. We develop a methodology, both in physical and spectral spaces, to diagnose three different components of wind work that force distinct classes of ocean motions, including high-frequency internal gravity waves, such as near-inertial oscillations, low-frequency currents such as those associated with eddies, and seasonally averaged currents, such as zonal tropical and equatorial jets. The total wind work, integrated globally, has a magnitude close to 5 TW, a value that matches recent estimates. Each of the first two components that force high-frequency and low-frequency currents, accounts for ∼ 28 \% of the total wind work and the third one that forces seasonally averaged currents, ∼ 44 \%. These three components, when integrated globally, weakly vary with seasons but their spatial distribution over the oceans has strong seasonal and latitudinal variations. In addition, the high-frequency component that forces internal gravity waves, is highly sensitive to the collocation in space and time (at scales of a few hours) of wind stresses and ocean currents. Furthermore, the low-frequency wind work component acts to dampen currents with a size smaller than 250 km and strengthen currents with larger sizes. This emphasizes the need to perform a full kinetic budget involving the wind work and nonlinear advection terms as small and larger-scale low-frequency currents interact through these nonlinear terms. The complex interplay of surface wind stresses and currents revealed by the numerical simulation motivates the need for winds and currents satellite missions to directly observe wind work.}},

While it has been well-studied at mesoscale wavelengths and longer, using both in-situ oceanographic measurements and satellite altimetry, the SSH wavenumber spectrum remains largely unknown for wavelengths less than \textbackslashtextasciitilde70km. The Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite mission aims to resolve the SSH wavenumber spectrum at 15-150km wavelengths, which is specified as one of the mission requirements. The mission calibration and validation (CalVal) requires the ground-truth of a synoptic SSH field resolving the targeted wavelengths, but no existing observational network is able to fulfill the task. We use a high-resolution global ocean simulation to conduct an Observing System Simulation Experiment (OSSE) to identify the suitable oceanographic in-situ measurements for SWOT SSH-CalVal. After fixing 20 measuring locations (the minimum number for resolving 15-150km wavelengths) along the SWOT swath, we have tested four instrument platforms: Pressure-Inverted-Echo-Sounder (PIES), Underway-Conductivity-Temperature-Depth (UCTD), instrumented mooring, and underwater glider. In the context of the OSSE, we found that for the target region and for SSH scales 15-70km, the PIES was an unsuitable tool; the slowness of a single-UCTD leads to significant aliasing by high-frequency motions at short wavelengths below \textbackslashtextasciitilde30 km; an array of station-keeping gliders can potentially meet the requirement; and an array of moorings is the most effective system among the four tested instruments in meeting the mission’s requirement. Results shown here warrant a prelaunch field campaign to further test the performance of station-keeping gliders.}},

The primary oceanographic objective is to characterize the ocean eddies at a spatial resolution of 15 km for 68\% of the ocean. This resolution is derived from the ratio between the wavenumber spectrum of the conventional altimeter (projected to submesoscale) and the SWOT SSH errors. While the 15-km threshold is useful as a global approximation of the spatial scales resolved by SWOT (SWOT-scale), it can be misleading for regional studies. Here we revisit the problem using a high-resolution (\textbackslashtextasciitilde2km horizontal grid spacing), tide-resolving global ocean simulation and map the SWOT-scale as a function of location and season. The results show that the SWOT-scale increases, in general, from about 15 km at low latitudes to \textbackslashtextasciitilde30-45 km at mid- and high-latitudes, but with a large geographical dependence. Smaller than 30 km SWOT-scale is expected in the high latitude energetic regions. The SWOT scale varies seasonally due to the seasonality in both the noise and the ocean signal. The seasonality also has a geographical dependence. Both eddies and internal gravity waves/tides have a significant contribution to the SWOT scale variation. Our analysis provides model predictions for interpreting the anticipated observations from SWOT and guidance for the development of analysis methodologies.}},

The year‐long observations show that near‐inertial motions are mainly generated by local wind forcing, and that they radiate equatorward and downward following several strong wind events (wind stress ≳0.5 N m−2). Observational estimates of horizontal group speed typically exceed those of vertical group speed by two orders of magnitude, consistent with predictions from the dispersion relation. Enhanced near‐inertial kinetic energy and vertical shear are found only in mesoscale anticyclones with Rossby number of O(0.1). By contrast, submesoscale motions with order one Rossby number have little effect on the trapping and vertical penetration of NIWs, due to their smaller horizontal scales, shorter time scales, and confined vertical extent compared to mesoscale eddies. Near‐inertial waves (NIWs) are excited mainly by variable winds at the ocean surface and can carry their energy into the ocean interior, thus playing an important role in mixing the deep ocean. However, the propagation behaviors of NIWs, and how such waves are affected by mesoscale and submesoscale processes, are still understudied, especially over periods of months to years. In this study, we examine an annual cycle of wind‐generated NIWs based on moored observations in a typical open‐ocean region of the northeast Atlantic. Our results show that NIWs propagate downward and equatorward following several strong wind events. Enhanced near‐inertial kinetic energy and vertical shear are found preferentially in regions of anticyclonic vorticity with Rossby number of O(0.1). By contrast, submesoscale anticyclones with Rossby number of O(1) are ineffective at trapping and accelerating near‐inertial motions into the ocean interior. This is due to the smaller horizontal scales, shorter time scales, and confined vertical extent of submesoscale motions compared to mesoscale eddies. Our findings highlight the major role of mesoscale anticyclones in draining NIWs from the upper ocean to the ocean interior, and have implications for detecting regions of active turbulent mixing driven by NIWs in the deep ocean. We provide observational evidence of downward‐ and equatorward‐propagating near‐inertial waves over a full annual cycle Enhanced near‐inertial kinetic energy and vertical shear are found preferentially in regions of anticyclonic vorticity The chimney effect for near‐inertial waves is very likely controlled by mesoscale, rather than submesoscale, anticyclones We provide observational evidence of downward‐ and equatorward‐propagating near‐inertial waves over a full annual cycle Enhanced near‐inertial kinetic energy and vertical shear are found preferentially in regions of anticyclonic vorticity The chimney effect for near‐inertial waves is very likely controlled by mesoscale, rather than submesoscale, anticyclones}},

abstract = {{Oceanic fronts with lateral scales less than 20 km are now known to be one of the major contributors to vertical heat fluxes in the global ocean, which highlights their potential impact on Earth's climate. However, frontal dynamics with time scales less than 1 day, whose contribution to vertical heat fluxes is thought to be significant, are obscured by energetic internal gravity waves (IGWs). In this study, we address this critical issue by separating IGWs and frontal dynamics using an approach based on their respective vertical scales of variability. Results using a numerical model with a horizontal grid spacing of 500 m confirm that it is possible to recover frontal dynamics at short time scales as well as associated intense vertical velocities and vertical heat fluxes. This opens up new possibilities for a more accurate estimation of the vertical exchanges of any tracers between the surface and the ocean interior. Two classes of motions involving large vertical velocities are present in the upper ocean: Those associated with small‐scale fronts (<20 km, also called submesoscale or SBM fronts) and those associated with internal gravity waves (IGWs). SBM fronts are known to explain most of the vertical transport of heat, nutrients, and major gases. IGWs do not transport tracers. Rather, small‐scale IGWs are thought to lead to irreversible mixing through breaking. One issue that arises when analyzing in‐situ observations and numerical simulations is how to discriminate between SBMs and IGWs when both classes of motions are energetic, such as in the California Current System. In this study, we show that SBM fronts and IGWs exhibit different vertical scales, which can be exploited to separate the two classes of motions. Our results confirm that filtering the contribution of large vertical scales to 3‐dimensional velocity fields leads to an almost complete recovery of SBM frontal dynamics at short time scales. The significance of this separation is illustrated by the impact of short‐time‐scale, frontal‐induced vertical velocity on vertical heat fluxes.

The SWOT Cal/Val needs in situ measurements that can make synoptic observations of SSH field over an O (100) km distance with an accuracy matching the SWOT requirements specified in terms of the along-track wavenumber spectrum of SSH error. No existing in situ observing system has been demonstrated to meet this challenge. A field campaign was conducted during September 2019–January 2020 to assess the potential of various instruments and platforms to meet the SWOT Cal/Val requirement. These instruments include two GPS buoys, two bottom pressure recorders (BPR), three moorings with fixed conductivity–temperature–depth (CTD) and CTD profilers, and a glider. The observations demonstrated that 1) the SSH (hydrostatic) equation can be closed with 1–3 cm RMS residual using BPR, CTD mooring and GPS SSH, and 2) using the upper-ocean steric height derived from CTD moorings enable subcentimeter accuracy in the California Current region during the 2019/20 winter. Given that the three moorings are separated at 10–20–30 km distance, the observations provide valuable information about the small-scale SSH variability associated with the ocean circulation at frequencies ranging from hourly to monthly in the region. The combined analysis sheds light on the design of the SWOT mission postlaunch Cal/Val field campaign.}},

abstract = {{After the surface water and ocean topography (SWOT) satellite launches in 2022, an in‐situ field campaign will be conducted to estimate the ocean state for calibration and validation (CalVal) purposes. It is demonstrably difficult to capture the sea surface height (SSH) features that are the focus of SWOT, with short time periods (<20 days) and fine‐scale spatial structures (15–150 km). Therefore, a critical component of the SWOT CalVal will be a data assimilation (DA) system coupled to a primitive equation numerical model that can estimate: (a) the 2D SSH over the SWOT swaths, and (b) the 3D dynamical (velocity) field. To explore the ability of DA to meet the challenges of SWOT fine‐scale observations, a multiscale DA system based on an extended 3D variational method has been developed. Here, we present a strategic evaluation of this DA system, with a focus to assimilate in‐situ data from an observing system to best represent the fine‐scale ocean variability at the CalVal site. The DA estimate is compared to independent observations taken during the 2019 pre‐launch field campaign 300‐km off Monterey Bay, California. The key result is this DA system can reconstruct the upper 500‐m steric height with O(1‐cm) error at hourly resolution, and subcentimeter error for periods longer than 2 days. The surface water and ocean topography (SWOT) satellite mission is the first of its kind to launch. It will provide unprecedented measurements of the sea surface height in two dimensions (2‐D) and shorter spatial scales than previously possible. These measurements will allow oceanographers to study new scales of ocean variability and infer the ocean current velocity field. After SWOT launches, the accuracy of its measurements will need to be verified with observations made using standard instrumentation whose accuracy is well known. However, the cost to produce equivalent measurements for comparison with 2‐D high‐resolution SWOT observations is prohibitive, so the instruments to be deployed are only sufficient to evaluate a small portion of the satellite footprint. To better understand the satellite measurements, the plan is to combine the instrument measurements with a numerical ocean model that provides a four‐dimensional best‐estimate of the ocean state. This is called data assimilation (DA). In this paper, we evaluate a DA system developed to address these challenges, and show its successful performance using observations from a pre‐launch field campaign in 2019. Data assimilation (DA) of routine observations of large/mesoscale circulation allows effective assimilation of mooring data at fine scales Mooring DA reconstructs 0‐ to 500‐m hourly steric height with O(1‐cm) error, and subcentimeter error for periods longer than 2‐day DA performance relies on observing system design; capturing the 2D horizontal gradient field is important for SWOT evaluation Data assimilation (DA) of routine observations of large/mesoscale circulation allows effective assimilation of mooring data at fine scales Mooring DA reconstructs 0‐ to 500‐m hourly steric height with O(1‐cm) error, and subcentimeter error for periods longer than 2‐day DA performance relies on observing system design; capturing the 2D horizontal gradient field is important for SWOT evaluation}},

abstract = {{Regional ocean general circulation models are generally forced at the boundaries by mesoscale ocean dynamics and barotropic tides. In this work we provide evidence that remotely forced internal waves can be a significant source of energy for the dynamics. We compare global and regional model solutions within the California Current System. Both models have similar inputs, forcings, and identical grids and numerics. The global model has a steric height power spectrum consistent with mooring observations at superinertial frequencies, while the regional model spectrum is weaker. The regional model also has less sea surface height variance at high wavenumber than the global model. The vertical velocity variance is significantly larger in the global model, except in the sheltered Southern California Bight. While the regional model has roughly equal high‐pass baroclinic and barotropic kinetic energy levels, the global model high‐pass baroclinic kinetic energy is 28\% (0.39 PJ) greater than the barotropic energy. An internal wave energy flux analysis reveals that the regional model domain boundaries act as a sink of 183 MW, while in the global model the analysis domain boundaries act as a source of 539 MW. This 722 MW difference can account for the relative increase of 0.39 PJ high‐pass baroclinic energy in the global model, assuming a baroclinic kinetic energy dissipation time in the domain of approximately 6.3 days. The results here imply that most regional ocean models will need to account for internal wave boundary fluxes in order to reproduce the observed internal wave continuum spectrum. Global ocean simulations can be too computationally expensive, so many researchers prefer to use lower cost regional ocean models. The open ocean boundary conditions of these regional models must be prescribed from other products. It is common practice for these prescribed conditions to lack high‐frequency oceanic variability. Here we show that this missing component of the dynamics may account for a large amount of the overall high‐frequency energy in the region. Without this, remotely forced energy input regional models may underestimate processes important to the overall state (e.g., upwelling processes fundamental to the ocean ecosystems). Regional models must account for these remotely forced dynamical signals in order to produce simulations with realistic short time‐ and space‐scale variability. Despite identical numerics, a regional model without remote internal wave forcing was unable to achieve the power spectra of a global run The analysis domain boundaries are a source of internal wave energy in the global model (+539 MW) but a sink in the regional run ( 183 MW) Boundary fluxes and a 6.3 day dissipation time scale explain the high‐frequency baroclinic kinetic energy differences in the simulations}},

SWOT will map the global and coastal oceans up to 77.6° latitude every 21 days over a swath of 120 km (20 km nadir gap). Today’s 2D mapped altimeter data can resolve ocean scales of 150 km wavelength whereas the SWOT measurement will extend our 2D observations down to 15–30 km, depending on sea state. SWOT will offer new opportunities to observe the oceanic dynamic processes at scales that are important in the generation and dissipation of kinetic energy in the ocean, and that facilitate the exchange of energy between the ocean interior and the upper layer. The active vertical exchanges linked to these scales have impacts on the local and global budgets of heat and carbon, and on nutrients for biogeochemical cycles. This review paper highlights the issues being addressed by the SWOT science community to understand SWOT’s very precise sea surface height (SSH)/surface pressure observations, and it explores how SWOT data will be combined with other satellite and in situ data and models to better understand the upper ocean 4D circulation (x, y, z, t) over the next decade. SWOT will provide unprecedented 2D ocean SSH observations down to 15–30 km in wavelength, which encompasses the scales of “balanced” geostrophic eddy motions, high-frequency internal tides and internal waves. This presents both a challenge in reconstructing the 4D upper ocean circulation, or in the assimilation of SSH in models, but also an opportunity to have global observations of the 2D structure of these phenomena, and to learn more about their interactions. At these small scales, ocean dynamics evolve rapidly, and combining SWOT 2D SSH data with other satellite or in situ data with different space-time coverage is also a challenge. SWOT’s new technology will be a forerunner for the future altimetric observing system, and so advancing on these issues today will pave the way for our future.}},

The technique consists of two steps: First, different baroclinic modes are decomposed by two-dimensional (2D) spatial filtering, utilizing their different horizontal wavelengths; second, multidirectional waves in each mode are decomposed by 2D plane wave analysis. The decomposition technique is demonstrated using the M2 internal tide field simulated by the MITgcm. This paper focuses on a region lying off the US West Coast ranging 20°–50°N, 220°–245°E. The lowest three baroclinic modes are separately resolved from the internal tide field; each mode is further decomposed into five waves of arbitrary propagation directions in horizontal. The decomposed fields yield unprecedented details on the internal tide’s generation and propagation, which cannot be observed in the harmonically fitted field. The results reveal that the mode-1 M2 internal tide in the study region is dominantly from the Hawaiian Ridge to the west, but also generated locally at the Mendocino Ridge and continental slope. The mode-2 and mode-3 M2 internal tides are generated at isolated seamounts, as well as the Mendocino Ridge and continental slope. The Mendocino Ridge radiates both southbound and northbound M2 internal tides for all three modes. Their propagation distances decrease with increasing mode number: Mode-1 waves can travel over 2000 km; while mode-3 waves can only be tracked for 300 km. The decomposition technique may be extended to other tidal constituents and to the global ocean.}},

It will use the technique of radar interferometry to measure sea surface height over a 120‐km‐wide swath with a 20‐km gap around the satellite's nadir track. The oceanographic objectives of the mission are to study ocean circulation at scales down to 15 km. To prepare for the evaluation of the mission's performance, we are undertaking a series of studies to explore the efficacy of an assimilative high‐resolution modeling system for estimating the state of the ocean based on independent observations from both spaceborne and in situ measurements. The system is based on the heritage of a multiscale approach to data assimilation by the Regional Ocean Modeling System. Observing System Simulation Experiments were first conducted in the setup of an identical twin experiment to assess the system's performance near the calibration/validation site of SWOT off the coast of California. The system was applied to a nested model domain with 1‐km resolution. Simulated satellite observations of SSH, sea surface temperature, salinity, in situ observations of upper ocean temperature, and salinity by profiling floats and a dedicated notional array of station‐keeping gliders were assimilated by the system. The results indicate that such an observing system can accurately estimate the state of the ocean, and in particular SSH for the evaluation of SWOT performance. A multiscale modeling and data assimilation system has been developed for the SWOT mission The data assimilation system is used to conduct Observing System Simulation Experiments (OSSEs) for SWOT calibration and validation It is shown that an observing system with an array of 20 station‐keeping gliders can reconstruct accurate SSH estimates for SWOT calibration and validation}},

abstract = {{Internal gravity waves (IGWs) and balanced motions (BMs) with scales <100‐km capture most of the vertical velocity field in the upper ocean. They have, however, different impacts on the ocean energy budget, which explains the need to partition motions into BMs and IGWs. One way is to exploit the synergy of using different satellite observations, the only observations with global coverage, and a reasonable spatial and temporal resolution. But we need first to characterize and understand their signatures on the different surface oceanic fields. This study addresses this issue by using an ocean global numerical simulation with high‐resolution (1/48°). Our methodology is based on the analysis of the 12,000 frequency‐wave number spectra to discriminate these two classes of motions in the surface kinetic energy, sea surface height, sea surface temperature, sea surface salinity, relative vorticity, and divergence fields and for two seasons. Results reveal a complex picture worldwide of the partition of motions between IGWs and BMs in the different surface fields, depending on the season, the hemisphere, and low and high eddy kinetic energy regions. But they also highlight some generic properties on the impact of these two classes of motions on the different fields. This points to the synergy of using present and future satellite observations to assess the ocean kinetic energy on a global scale. The 12,000 frequency‐wave number spectra represent a World Ocean Atlas of the surface ocean dynamics not fully exploited in the present study. We hope the use of this World Ocean Atlas by other studies will lead to extend much these results. Motivation of partitioning surface oceanic motions with scales <100 km into two classes, balanced motions (BMs) and internal gravity waves (IGWs), is that they are known to have different impacts on the ocean kinetic budget although they share the same range of spatial and temporal scales. Satellite observations are the only ones with a global coverage to capture oceanic surface motions. Our motivation of exploiting the synergy of using all these observations is that these two classes of motions can have different signatures on each of these observations. The results reveal a complex picture worldwide of the partition of motions between IGWs and BMs in the different surface fields, depending on the season, the hemisphere, and low and high eddy kinetic energy regions. But they also highlight some generic properties on the impact of these two classes of motions on the different fields. This emphasizes the strong synergy of using present and future satellite observations to diagnose this partition on a global scale. The results can be of interest for Earth Science community because of their consequences on the ocean kinetic energy budget, the physical‐biological interactions, and the air‐sea interactions.

With the exception of the Pacific and Indian sectors of the Southern Ocean, the seasonal KE uctuations of the surface balanced and unbalanced motions are out-of phase due to occurrence of mixed layer instability in winter and trapping of unbalanced motion KE in shallow mixed layer in summer. The combined effect of these seasonal changes renders Lt to be < 20 km during winter in 80\% of the Northern Hemisphere oceans between 25°-45°N and all of the Southern-Hemisphere oceans south of 25°S. The transition scale’s geographical and seasonal changes are highly relevant to the forthcoming Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission.

This unique transport property is not captured in climate models that have insufficient resolution to simulate these submesoscale dynamics. Here, we use an ocean model with an unprecedented resolution that, for the first time, globally resolves submesoscale heat transport. Upper-ocean submesoscale turbulence produces a systematically-upward heat transport that is five times larger than mesoscale heat transport, with winter-time averages up to 100 W/m2 for mid-latitudes. Compared to a lower-resolution model, submesoscale heat transport warms the sea surface up to 0.3 °C and produces an upward annual-mean air–sea heat flux anomaly of 4–10 W/m2 at mid-latitudes. These results indicate that submesoscale dynamics are critical to the transport of heat between the ocean interior and the atmosphere, and are thus a key component of the Earth’s climate. Oceanic motions associated with horizontal scales smaller than 50 km remain unresolved in climate models. Here the authors show that motions in this scale range are critical to the global transport of heat between the ocean interior and the atmosphere, and are thus a key component of the Earth’s climate.}},

However, the exact pathways and role of topography in Southern Ocean upwelling remain largely unknown. Here we show detailed upwelling pathways in three dimensions, using hydrographic observations and particle tracking in high-resolution models. The analysis reveals that the northern-sourced deep waters enter the Antarctic Circumpolar Current via southward flow along the boundaries of the three ocean basins, before spiraling southeastward and upward through the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Upwelling is greatly enhanced at five major topographic features, associated with vigorous mesoscale eddy activity. Deep water reaches the upper ocean predominantly south of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, with a spatially nonuniform distribution. The timescale for half of the deep water to upwell from 30° S to the mixed layer is \textbackslashtextasciitilde60–90 years. Deep waters of the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans upwell in the Southern Oceanbut the exact pathways are not fully characterized.

Located in the Indian sector and spanning nearly 2000 km in the meridional direction from the polar to the subantarctic region, it deflects the eastward-flowing Antarctic Circumpolar Current and influences the physical circulation and biogeochemistry of the Southern Ocean. The Kerguelen Plateau is known to govern the local dynamics, but its impact on the large-scale ocean circulation has not been explored. By comparing global ocean numerical simulations with and without the Kerguelen Plateau, this study identifies two major Kerguelen Plateau effects: 1) The plateau supports a local pressure field that pushes the Antarctic Circumpolar Current northward. This process reduces the warm-water transport from the Indian to the Atlantic Ocean. 2) The plateau-generated pressure field shields the Weddell Gyre from the influence of the warmer subantarctic and subtropical waters. The first effect influences the strength of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and the Agulhas leakage, both of which are important elements in the global thermohaline circulation. The second effect results in a zonally asymmetric response of the subpolar gyres to Southern Hemisphere wind forcing.}},

The sea level changes in the southeast Indian Ocean are strongly influenced by the low-frequency westward-propagating waves originated in the tropical Pacific, whereas those in the southwest Indian Ocean respond mainly to the local wind forcing. Analyses of the lead-lag correlation further reveal the different origins of interannual and interdecadal variabilities in the tropical Pacific. The interannual wave signals are dominated by the wind variability along the equatorial Pacific, which is associated with the El Niño-Southern Oscillation; whereas the interdecadal signals are driven mainly by the wind curl off the equatorial Pacific, which is closely related to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation.}},

The subsurface field is augmented by the addition of the barotropic and first baroclinic modes, whose amplitudes are determined by matching to the sea surface height (pressure), after subtracting the SQG contribution. An additional constraint is that the bottom pressure anomaly vanishes. The method is tested for three regions in the North Atlantic using data from a high-resolution numerical simulation. The decomposition yields strikingly realistic subsurface fields. It is particularly successful in energetic regions like the Gulf Stream extension and at high latitudes where the mixed layer is deep, but it also works in less energetic eastern subtropics. The demonstration highlights the possibility of reconstructing three-dimensional oceanic flows using a combination of satellite fields, for example, sea surface temperature (SST) and SSH, and sparse (or climatological) estimates of the regional depth-resolved density.

However, the long radiating modes can overcome friction by nonlinear energy input transferred from the more unstable trapped mode and play an important role in the energy budget of the boundary current system. The nonlinearly powered long radiating modes take away part of the perturbation energy from the instability origin to the ocean interior.
